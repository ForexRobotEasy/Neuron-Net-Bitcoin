## Installation

Before using this code, ensure that you have the following libraries installed:

- `Python.mqh`: This library provides integration with Python.

## Getting Started

To start using Neuron Net Bitcoin, follow these steps:

1. Load the Neuron Net Bitcoin AI model by calling `Py_LoadModel('neuron_net_bitcoin_model.h5')` in the `OnInit()` function.
2. Check if the model is loaded successfully using the `model` variable.
3. In the `OnTick()` function, get the current BTCUSD price using `SymbolInfoDouble(_Symbol, SYMBOL_BID)`.
4. Prepare the input data for the AI model using `Py_PrepareInputData(currentPrice)`.
5. Check if the input data is prepared successfully using the `inputData` variable.
6. Get the predicted price movement from the AI model using `Py_PredictMovement(model, inputData)`.
7. Check if the prediction is reliable by comparing it with a threshold value (0.5 in this case).
8. If the predicted movement is greater than 0.5, open a buy position using `OrderSend(_Symbol, OP_BUY, 0.01, currentPrice, 0, 0, 0, 'Neuron Net Bitcoin')`.
9. If the predicted movement is less than -0.5, open a sell position using `OrderSend(_Symbol, OP_SELL, 0.01, currentPrice, 0, 0, 0, 'Neuron Net Bitcoin')`.
10. Clean up resources by calling `Py_CleanUp(inputData)` in the `OnTick()` function.
11. Unload the Neuron Net Bitcoin AI model using `Py_UnloadModel(model)` in the `OnDeinit()` function.

Please note that this code is a simplified version and should be customized and adapted to your specific trading environment and requirements.
